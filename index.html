      <p>I'll be detailing what I deem important from the contents of the course.</p>
      <h1>Rem</h1>
      <p>Rem is a unit of measurment in css; it stants for root em. Unlike em which checks for parent element, rem checks for root element; which is the HTML element.</p>
      <h1>Percentages:Height and Width</h1>
      <p>Used to size non-text html elements relative to their parent(also known as a container). Often used to size box-model values like width and height, padding, border, and margins. Be carefull when using 100% for contents may overflow its parents container</p>

      <p>We took a catamaran from the marina to Failaka Island, where we got to explore a bit, relax on the beach, and go swimming. The water in the Gulf is incredibly still; I havent seen a wave yet, and when you look out on the horizon it seems to go forever. Something about the color of the water and maybe the dust in the air make it seem hazier than the Atlantic coast. I have some cool pictures of the city skyline as we returned on the boat.</p>
      <p>That night, I hung out in a cafe with two friends, drinking traditional lemonade with mint. Its delicious; maybe I should send in a flavor suggestion to Morano Gelato? Then we drove around the city for a while. Cruising around is a really valid way to spend the time when a tank of gas costs about seven bucks. </p>
