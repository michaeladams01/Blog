      <h1><strong class="opening-line">Learn Responsive Design</strong></h1>
      <p>A responsive website is a site that responds to the size of the screen it is viewed on.</p>
      <h4>Rem, Percentages:Height and Width</h4>
      <p>Rem is a unit of measurment in css; it stants for root em. Unlike em which checks for parent element, rem checks for root element; which is the HTML element.Percentages are used to size non-text html elements relative to their parent(also known as a container). Often used to size box-model values like width and height, padding, border, and margins. Be carefull when using 100% for contents may overflow its parents container</p>
      <h1>Media Queries</h1>
      <p>Media Queries use media features; conditions that must be met to render css within a media query. Media features can detect many aspects of a user's browser includin: the screen's height, widht, andCSS uses media queries to adapt content to different screen sizes. CSS detects the the current screen size and apply different CSS styles depending on the width of the screen</p>
      <p>Sprecific screen sizes can be targetted by setting multiple with and height media features. min-width and max-height are used to set the minimum with and maximum height.
      By using multiple with and height, a range can be set. Example (@media only screen and (min-width:320px) and (max-width:480px){ruleset for 320px - 480px})</p>
